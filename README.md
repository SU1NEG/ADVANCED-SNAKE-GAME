# ADVANCED-SNAKE-GAME
I will make an advanced snake game project. It will be in Python language, There will be two snakes randomly born in the same environment. One will be controlled by the player, that is, me, and the other will be controlled by AI. I will use the dfs algorithm for the snake controlled by AI. The bait will be in a classically random area in the same environment. The snakes will grow a little each time they eat the bait. After each bait eaten, the snakes will immediately appear in another random area. The snakes can pass over each other. If the snakes hit the edges, they will come out from the opposite edges. There will be 2 counters that follow the score of the snakes, and their score will increase by one for each bait eaten. I will add a margin of error of 25% for the AI snake. (can be increased or decreased depending on the difficulty) Sometimes it will go in the opposite direction it should go and in the same way, in order to increase the difficulty, the player will be given empty baits and it will not be counted even if it passes over it.
