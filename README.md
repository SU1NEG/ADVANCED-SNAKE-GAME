# ADVANCED-SNAKE-GAME
I will make an advanced snake game project. It will be in Python language. There will be two snakes randomly born in the same environment. One will be controlled by the player, that is, me, and the other will be controlled by artificial intelligence. I will use dfs and bfs algorithm for the snake controlled by artificial intelligence. The bait will classically be in a random area in the same environment. The snakes will grow a little larger each time they eat the bait. After each meal you eat, snakes will immediately appear in another random area. Snakes cannot pass over each other; if the head of one of them hits the tail of the other, the one whose head hits the other loses the game. If snakes hit the edges, they come out from the opposite edges. There will be 2 counters that track the snakes scores, and their scores will increase by one for each bait eaten. I will add a 15% margin of error for the AI snake. (can be increased or decreased depending on the difficulty) Sometimes it will go in the opposite direction it should go. The player can knowingly get in front of the snake, the snake will understand this and apply the strategy of going through different paths.
